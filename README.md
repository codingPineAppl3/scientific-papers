## How to optimize product recommendations using machine learning (graded 1.7)  
Abstract: In the last two decades, e-commerce has developed itself from a niche market to one of the most prominent players in product distribution. Nowadays, online shops offer an enormous amount of products to their customers. With a large amount of data, it has become a challenge to process and provide valuable data to customers to fulfill their needs and choice of products. Big players like Amazon have been using recommendation engines with machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering, hybrid filtering, content-based filtering, etc., to overcome real-time product recommendations for their customers. This paper will look at state-of-the-art recommendation engines and their algorithms. We will determine how to optimize a recommendation engine which recommends consumers quality products.
